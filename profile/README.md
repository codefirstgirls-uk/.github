# Codefirstgirls Organisation Documentation

Welcome to the CFG github organiastion! If this is your first time, please take the time to read through this document to orient yourself in this new strange place. In this organisation page, you'll find every repository for course content managed by CFG.

### For instructors

Welcome to teaching with CFG! To get setup with each course, you'll likely need to install some software and download the required course material for each session. The easiest thing is to navigate to the course your teaching and doing a git clone on the repository:
```console
# example for downloading any course material
git clone git@github.com:codefirstgirls-uk/<course-repository>.git

# example for downloading the foundation course materials
git clone git@github.com:codefirstgirls-uk/cfg-foundation-public.git
```

If you ever find yourself missing permissions, please don't hesitate to reach out to a member of CFG staff on Slack!
