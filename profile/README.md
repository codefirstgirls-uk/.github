# Codefirstgirls Organisation Documentation

Welcome to the CFG github organiastion! If this is your first time, please take the time to read through this document to orient yourself in this new strange place. In this organisation page, you'll find every repository for course content managed by CFG.

If you are student, this allows you to quickly navigate to the content you will need for the course you're enrolled to. Please see the <b>For students</b> section below for more information.

If you are an instructor, here you'll find all the material required for teaching the course, as well as improving it if you catch any bugs! Please see the <b>For instrutors</b> section for more information.

## For students

Welcome to the CFG courses! If you are starting a new course, head on over to the dedicated repository (see links below!) for your course. Each course has its own repository (repository is just a fancy folder!). Within each repository you'll find subfolders for every session. Inside of these you'll find the actual course content which might include slides, exercises, and coding examples. 

If you have not set up Github (don't worry if you havent't!), you can download material for each class by clicking the "download zip" for any given repository. [Click here for a guide on how to download as zip](https://github.com/Mottie/GitHub-userscripts/wiki/GitHub-download-zip).

If you have installed github you can download all the required course material via git commands. Open a terminal (if you are on windows we recommend [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)!) and write the following commands to download the repository locally (a.k.a. cloning):
```console
# example for downloading any course material
git clone git@github.com:codefirstgirls-uk/<course-repository>.git

# example for downloading the foundation course materials
git clone git@github.com:codefirstgirls-uk/cfg-foundation-public.git
```

## For instructors

Welcome to teaching with CFG! To get setup with each course, you'll likely need to install some software and download the required course material for each session. The easiest thing is to navigate to the course your teaching and doing a git clone on the repository:
```console
# example for downloading any course material
git clone git@github.com:codefirstgirls-uk/<course-repository>.git

# example for downloading the foundation course materials
git clone git@github.com:codefirstgirls-uk/cfg-foundation-public.git
```
